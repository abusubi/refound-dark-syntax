## Refound Dark Syntax theme

#### Update: Comments are lighter in weight and lighter in color to better differentiate between code and guidance. JetBrains Mono is recommended for this version of the dark-syntax theme for efficient scanning and vertical legibility.

Original package is part of the [core Atom repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax), please direct all issues and pull requests there in the future!

> JetBrains Mono available for free here: [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting it from the __Syntax Themes__ drop-down menu.
